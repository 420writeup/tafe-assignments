  <h1>Cybersecurity Terms</h1>

  <h2>Botnets</h2>
  <p>A botnet is a network of compromised computers, often referred to as "bots" or "zombies," that are controlled by a malicious actor. These compromised machines are usually infected with malware that allows the attacker to remotely control them. Botnets can be used for various malicious activities, including sending spam emails, launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, spreading malware, stealing sensitive data, and more.</p>

  <h2>Malware</h2>
  <p>Malware, short for malicious software, is a term used to describe any software designed to harm, exploit, or compromise computer systems, networks, or devices. Malware can include viruses, worms, Trojans, spyware, ransomware, adware, and more. It is typically spread through infected email attachments, malicious downloads, compromised websites, and other means. Malware can steal data, disrupt system operations, and create security vulnerabilities.</p>

  <h2>Viruses</h2>
  <p>A computer virus is a type of malware that attaches itself to legitimate programs or files and spreads when those files are executed. Viruses can self-replicate and infect other files, potentially causing damage to data, applications, or the operating system. They often require human interaction to spread, such as opening an infected email attachment. Antivirus software and security measures are used to detect and remove viruses.</p>

  <h2>Worms</h2>
  <p>Worms are another form of self-replicating malware, but unlike viruses, they don't require a host program to attach to. Worms can spread independently across networks and systems, taking advantage of security vulnerabilities. They can consume network resources, slow down systems, and cause disruptions. Worms can spread through various means, including email, instant messaging, and network shares.</p>
