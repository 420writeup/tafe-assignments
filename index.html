  <h1>Cyber-security Threats</h1>
  
  <h2 id="cyber-security-threat">Cyber-security Threat</h2>
  <p>A cyber-security threat refers to any potential event, activity, or circumstance that has the potential to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of computer systems, networks, and digital information. These threats encompass a wide range of malicious actions and vulnerabilities, including hacking attempts, data breaches, malware infections, and unauthorized access. Cyber-security threats can originate from both external sources, such as hackers and cybercriminals, as well as internal sources, like employees or individuals within an organization.</p>
  
  <h2 id="threat-actors">Threat Actors</h2>
  <p>Threat actors are individuals, groups, or entities that initiate, execute, or orchestrate cyber attacks with the intention of causing harm, gaining unauthorized access, or achieving specific goals. Threat actors can vary widely in terms of their motivations, capabilities, and targets. They can include hackers, hacktivists, cybercriminal organizations, state-sponsored groups, and even insiders within an organization. Understanding the motives and tactics of threat actors is crucial for effective cyber-security measures.</p>
  
  <h2 id="threat-vectors">Threat Vectors</h2>
  <p>Threat vectors are the pathways, methods, or mechanisms through which cyber-security threats are delivered to target systems or networks. These vectors serve as entry points for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities and gain unauthorized access. Threat vectors can include various forms of attack, such as phishing emails, malicious attachments, compromised websites, social engineering tactics, and software vulnerabilities. Identifying and mitigating threat vectors is essential for preventing cyber attacks.</p>
  
  <h2 id="threat-goals">Threat Goals</h2>
  <p>Threat goals refer to the objectives that threat actors aim to achieve through their cyber attacks. These goals can vary depending on the motivations of the attacker. Common threat goals include data theft, financial gain, disruption of services, espionage, identity theft, and reputation damage. Understanding the specific goals of threat actors can help organizations prioritize their defenses and develop strategies to mitigate potential risks.</p>

  <h1>Cybersecurity Terms</h1>

  <h2 id="botnets">Botnets</h2>
  <p>A botnet is a network of compromised computers, often referred to as "bots" or "zombies," that are controlled by a malicious actor. These compromised machines are usually infected with malware that allows the attacker to remotely control them. Botnets can be used for various malicious activities, including sending spam emails, launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, spreading malware, stealing sensitive data, and more.</p>

  <h2 id="malware">Malware</h2>
  <p>Malware, short for malicious software, is a term used to describe any software designed to harm, exploit, or compromise computer systems, networks, or devices. Malware can include viruses, worms, Trojans, spyware, ransomware, adware, and more. It is typically spread through infected email attachments, malicious downloads, compromised websites, and other means. Malware can steal data, disrupt system operations, and create security vulnerabilities.</p>

  <h2 id="viruses">Viruses</h2>
  <p>A computer virus is a type of malware that attaches itself to legitimate programs or files and spreads when those files are executed. Viruses can self-replicate and infect other files, potentially causing damage to data, applications, or the operating system. They often require human interaction to spread, such as opening an infected email attachment. Antivirus software and security measures are used to detect and remove viruses.</p>

  <h2 id="worms">Worms</h2>
  <p>Worms are another form of self-replicating malware, but unlike viruses, they don't require a host program to attach to. Worms can spread independently across networks and systems, taking advantage of security vulnerabilities. They can consume network resources, slow down systems, and cause disruptions. Worms can spread through various means, including email, instant messaging, and network shares.</p>
