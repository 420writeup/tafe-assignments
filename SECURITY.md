## Security Measures

### Access Control

We implement strict access control measures to ensure that only authorized personnel have access to the repository. This includes:

- Enforcing two-factor authentication (2FA) for all contributors.
- Limiting administrative access to essential team members.
- Regularly reviewing and revoking access for inactive contributors.

### Code Reviews

All code changes are subject to thorough code reviews by team members. This process helps identify and address security vulnerabilities before they are merged into the main codebase.

### Branch Protection

We enforce branch protection rules to control code changes and ensure secure coding practices. These rules include:

- Requiring code reviews before merging.
- Preventing force pushes to protected branches.
- Requiring status checks to pass before merging.

### Security Updates

We stay proactive in addressing security vulnerabilities by regularly updating dependencies, libraries, and frameworks. This ensures that our project is protected against known security vulnerabilities.

### Reporting Suspicious Activity

If you notice any suspicious activity related to our repository, such as unauthorized access or changes, please report it to our security team immediately.
